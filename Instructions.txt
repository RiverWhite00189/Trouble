Instructions:
Set Up:
Each player has four pegs of the same color and in their color's home. 
Objective:
Players move their pegs around the board, trying to get all four of their pegs into their color's finish line to win.
Rolling the dice:
Players take turns rolling the die by pressing the Pop-O-Matic bubble. Red goes first and everyone else follows clockwise.
If a player rolls a 6, they may take out a peg from their home. Note: pegs & actions are chosen by the user in the terminal.
If they roll any other number, they may move a peg of their color already on the board that many spaces. 
Another player in space:
If another peg, even your own color, is in the place your peg wants to move, it will return the original peg back to it's home.
Entering the finish line:
If you are lucky, you will land on your color's start space. Only this will allow you to enter that peg into the finish line. 
If you are even one space more, you will have to go all the way around again. 
Winning:
The first player to get all four of their pegs into the finish line wins.
