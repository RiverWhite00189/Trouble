## Trouble
This program runs a game of Trouble for 4 players. A player wins once all their pieces have entered the final line! (Check out the game & its files for a full manual!)

## New Stuff! (Sort of)
I worked a bunch with pygame this time!

## Why was this Developed?

ENGR 102 final project that I did all myself... 

# Note:
  - Win conditions are significantly harder than a regular game of Trouble (it will take forever to finish)
      - Why? You need to feel the pain of this all-nighter too :D
